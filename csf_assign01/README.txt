This project was done individually. All functions for MS1 and MS2 are complete and tested. 

Several helper methods were added to support the primary methods.  "fixedpoint.c" and "fixpoint.h" both
contain detailed comments on each of these added methods. 

The largest non-testing method was 22 lines (not counting whitespace, comments, or end-brackets).

A comprehesive testing file is included.  All methods are tested, including most border cases. Some of 
the smaller methods are tested implicitly as part of other functions' tests.
