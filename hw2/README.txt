Draft- submitting just to have something submitted
Plan to use late hours due to 4 midterms this week + an unforseen work emergency

Update I think this version is done, and submitted before the deadline (still going to check it)

This project was done individually. The C functions work as expected with a full set of tests.

The three required (MS1) functions for the assembly language implementation are also created and tested.
